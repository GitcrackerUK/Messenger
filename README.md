### Bot Chat

Bot Chat is a simple app allowing any one to have conversation\
              with AI. Itâ€™s simple and fun. You can type what ever you like and\
              you will get response to your message. Some responses are even\
              funny but sometimes without sense but it's fine, we don't need\
              super computer to tell us what to do. It is design in figma,\
              programmed in React and hosted on Gcloud.\
